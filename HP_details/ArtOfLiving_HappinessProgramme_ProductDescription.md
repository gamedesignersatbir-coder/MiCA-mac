## PRODUCT DESCRIPTION (Copy-paste into MiCA)

---

**The Art of Living Happiness Programme** is a transformative 4-day workshop designed to help people break free from stress, anxiety, and emotional fatigue — and rediscover a deep sense of calm, clarity, and joy. At the heart of the programme is **Sudarshan Kriya™**, a powerful, scientifically validated rhythmic breathing technique created by Gurudev Sri Sri Ravi Shankar in 1982, which synchronises the body, breath, and mind to release stress at its deepest root.

### What Participants Learn

Over 4 days, participants experience a progressive, immersive journey combining:

- **Sudarshan Kriya™** — The flagship breathing technique of Art of Living. A unique sequence of specific natural breathing rhythms that purifies the body, calms the nervous system, and leads the practitioner into effortless deep meditation. "Sudarshan" means "right vision of the self"; "Kriya" means "purifying action."
- **Pranayamas (Yogic Breathing Exercises)** — Traditional breathwork techniques including Nadi Shodhana (alternate nostril breathing), Bhastrika, and Ujjayi, taught progressively to expand lung capacity and regulate the nervous system.
- **Yoga & Gentle Movement** — Simple, accessible yoga postures that release physical tension from the body, preparing the system for deeper meditation.
- **Guided Meditation** — Daily guided meditation sessions that help participants access stillness, inner awareness, and clarity of mind.
- **Practical Wisdom for Daily Life** — Interactive discussions and experiential exercises that offer tools for managing emotions, improving relationships, navigating challenges, and cultivating a positive mindset.

### About the Technique — Sudarshan Kriya™

Sudarshan Kriya™ came into existence in 1982 when Gurudev Sri Sri Ravi Shankar emerged from a 10-day period of silence in Shimoga, India. It has since been taught to over **500 million people** across 182 countries and has been adopted in UN programmes, corporate wellness initiatives, military rehabilitation, and prison reforms worldwide.

The technique works by using specific natural rhythms of the breath to harmonise the biological rhythms of the body and mind. In a short time, it dissolves accumulated emotional residue, increases energy, and produces a state of deep calm that is difficult to achieve through conventional meditation alone.
