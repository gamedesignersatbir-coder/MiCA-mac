# Landing Page Skill

A skill for designing and writing high-converting landing pages based on established psychological principles and Julian Shapiro's "Landing Page Guide."

## Mental Model
**Purchase Rate = Desire - (Labor + Confusion)**
- **Desire**: Maximized through strong value propositions and social proof.
- **Labor**: Minimized through clear CTAs and simple onboarding.
- **Confusion**: Reduced through clarity, specificity, and logical visual hierarchy.

## Core Components
1. **Hero Section**: The hook that determines retention.
2. **Value Propositions**: Transformation-focused benefits.
3. **Social Proof**: Trust signals (logos, testimonials).
4. **Objection Handling**: Crushing friction points directly.
5. **Clear CTAs**: Instruction-based buttons.

## Best Practices
- **Specificity Over Fluff**: "Save 2 hours" vs "Be productive."
- **Benefit Over Feature**: "Never miss a deadline" vs "Calendar sync."
- **Conversational Copy**: Write for humans, using "You" and "Your."

## Workflows
1. Research product-market fit and target audience.
2. Define the "End Transformation" (The Result).
3. Use the formulas in `references/formulas.md` to draft copy.
4. Organize sections following the visual hierarchy patterns in `references/julian-guide.md`.
