# Julian Shapiro's Landing Page Summary

## Summary of Techniques

### 1. The Hero Section
- **The "High-Level Hook"**: You have 5 seconds to explain what you do.
- **Visuals**: Show, don't tell. Use a product screenshot, a video, or an illustration that clarifies the value.
- **Micro-Copy**: Use tiny text around the CTA (e.g., "No credit card required") to reduce friction.

### 2. Narrative Arc
A landing page should tell a story:
1. **The Hero**: What is the dream state?
2. **The Problem**: Why can't I reach it now?
3. **The Solution**: How does this product get me there?
4. **The Proof**: Who else has done it?
5. **The Final Push**: Ready to start?

### 3. Visual Hierarchy
- **Scanning Pattern**: Users scan in an 'F' or 'Z' pattern. Place the most important info in these paths.
- **Weight**: Larger fonts and high-contrast colors for headers and CTAs.

### 4. Benefit-Feature Matrix
| Feature | Benefit | The "So What?" |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 24/7 Support | Help whenever you need it | You're never stuck or losing money. |
| AI Summaries | Read less, know more | Save 30 mins every morning on news. |

### 5. Social Proof
- Better to have 3 high-quality testimonials than 20 generic ones.
- Include names, faces, and titles to humanize the proof.
